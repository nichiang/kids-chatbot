**Educational Impact**: Eliminates the frustrating user experience where the system says "let's continue with our story!" but then doesn't actually continue it, providing complete educational satisfaction and story flow.

### Phase 15: Multiple Story Design Phase Restoration (CRITICAL EDUCATIONAL CONTINUITY FIX)
**Goal**: Fix critical issue where design phase was never triggered for second/third stories and design fields weren't reset
- ✅ **Root Cause Analysis**: New story generation bypassed design phase logic entirely and didn't reset design fields
- ✅ **Comprehensive Field Reset**: Added reset for ALL 12 design-related session fields between stories
- ✅ **Enhanced Entity System Integration**: New stories now use same entity detection logic as first stories

- ✅ **Validation Logic Enhanced**: Both named and unnamed entities now trigger design phases
- ✅ **Design Flow Differentiation**: Named entities skip naming, go directly to appearance/personality/dreams/skills
- ✅ **Priority System**: Unnamed entities get full design (naming + aspects), named entities get aspect design
- ✅ **Random Aspect Selection**: Variety in educational experience through random aspect choice
- ✅ **Complete Flow Testing**: Verified all entity types now provide engaging interactions

**Technical Details**:
- **Files Modified**: `backend/app.py` - `validate_entity_structure()`, `get_next_design_entity()`, `trigger_enhanced_design_phase()`
- **Enhanced Return Format**: `get_next_design_entity()` now returns `(entity_type, entity_descriptor, is_named)` tuple
- **Smart Design Logic**: Named entities start with random aspect (appearance/personality/dreams/skills)
- **Educational Continuity**: All stories now provide design opportunities followed by story continuation

**Educational Impact**: Eliminates dead-end stories where students receive initial paragraph with no follow-up interaction, ensuring consistent educational engagement regardless of entity types in generated content.

#### Critical Bug Fixes - Previous Session
